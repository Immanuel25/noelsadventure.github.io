This paper presents the design, construction, and control of a low-cost Stewart platform prototype, addressing the lack of affordable options for research and education compared to expensive commercial systems.
The platform achieves full six-DOF motion using six linear actuators connecting a moving platform to a fixed base.
A robust trajectory tracking controller based on feedback linearization compensates for the system’s nonlinear dynamics, while an Extended Kalman Filter fuses actuator encoder and IMU measurements for accurate real-time state estimation.
The proposed framework is validated through simulation and experimental tests on static and dynamic trajectories.
Results demonstrate effective trajectory tracking and reliable state estimation under realistic sensor noise and disturbances, confirming the platform’s suitability as an accessible research and educational tool.
