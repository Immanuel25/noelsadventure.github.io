This paper develop a framework for system modeling and control design to improve the robustness and automation level of a spinbath circulation system. 
The system modeling use grey-box modeling method, each system component is initially modeled using a first-principles approach, then the resulting equations are linearized and approximated as transfer function. 
System identification based on historical data is then performed to each dynamic component model, with initial estimates obtained through graphical inspection. 
These component models are subsequently integrated to form a unified input-output system model representation.
These estimates are then refined using nonlinear optimization and shows a fitting accuracy of 86.69\% on the system model. 
Three control configurations for head tank level are designed: (i) single-loop (current system), (ii) conventional cascade, and (iii) summed-setpoint cascade.
Simulations show that the fully-automatic summed-setpoint cascade configurations achieves a 28.58\% reduction in peak error and 40.30\% reduction in integral absolute error compared to semi-automatic single-loop configurations, significantly improving control accuracy and performance.
