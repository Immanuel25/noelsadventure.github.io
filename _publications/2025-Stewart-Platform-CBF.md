This paper presents a closed-form solution of a Control Barrier Function (CBF) formulation for ensuring safety in the operation of a Stewart platform prototype.
The proposed controller simultaneously enforces position and velocity constraints, using an energy-based CBF for position safety and a standard CBF for velocity safety.
Instead of solving the associated safety Quadratic Program (QP) at each control step, an explicit closed-form solution is derived to compute the safe control inputs, significantly reducing computational cost and enabling real-time implementation.
Simulation results demonstrate that the closed-form and QP-based methods yield identical control actions and successfully guarantee safe operation.
Experimental validation on the developed prototype further confirms the suitability of the closed-form approach for real-time deployment in safety-critical parallel robotic systems.
